Object Detection Projects
==============================
This project is to detect personal protective equipments 

## Main Precedures
1. **Import PPE dataset from Roboflow**
2. **Train the YOLOv8 model on the custom dataset**
  - Epoch size = 20
  - Image size = 640
  - Batch size = 8
3. **Display training results**
4. **Validate custom model**
5. **Use custom model to predict on test images or videos**
